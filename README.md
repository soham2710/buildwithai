## Overview

In this notebook, you will explore a variety of use cases enabled by Gemini 1.5 in the context of education.

### Gemini

Gemini is a family of generative AI models developed by Google DeepMind.

### Gemini 1.5

The Gemini 1.5 models are built for multimodality from the ground up:

- Supported inputs: Text, code, images, audio, video, video with audio, and PDF
- Generated output: Text

### Vertex AI Gemini API

The Vertex AI Gemini API provides a unified interface for interacting with the Gemini models. There are currently two Gemini 1.5 models available using the Gemini API:

- **Gemini 1.5 Flash** (`gemini-1.5-flash`) for fast and versatile performance across a diverse variety of tasks
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro** (`gemini-1.5-pro`) for complex reasoning tasks such as code and text generation, text editing, problem solving, data extraction and generation
